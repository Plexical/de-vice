 De-Vice

*Responsive images for Python-based servers using in-depth user agent analysis*

The first, minimal iteration of De-Vice will only support two classes of
devices (more to come in the future):

Small screen landscape
----------------------

(320px -) 480 px wide. Assume 3G network (increase compression)

Larger
------

Larger than 480px. Assume WLAN.
